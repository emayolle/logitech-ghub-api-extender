## Context
The [Logitech G-Hub](https://www.logitechg.com/fr-fr/innovation/g-hub.html) is an application platform designed to integrate various [Logitech devices](https://www.logitechg.com/), offering a centralized control interface for users to manage their connected hardware. This includes devices like keyboards, mice, speakers, and more, allowing for streamlined interaction and automation.

The [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) API provided by the Logitech G-Hub is a powerful tool that enables programmable control over these devices using the Lua scripting language. Every G-series Profile has a default Lua script bound to it which can be edited and customized.
The script is invoked using an event handler, OnEvent. Users may examine the various events
exposed in this handler to perform their desired actions.

The Lua version used is [Lua 5.4](https://www.lua.org/versions.html#5.4) with methods or functions added by the Logitech G-Hub API.

> **Note**
> Logitech Lua API can be found on [this page](https://douile.com/logitech-toggle-keys/APIDocs.pdf).
